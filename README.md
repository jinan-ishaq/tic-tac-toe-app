# Overview

I designed and developed a fully responsive Tic-Tac-Toe game from the ground up, ensuring a seamless experience for users across all devices. The game allows two players to input their names at the beginning, making it more personalized. Once the game begins, it dynamically detects when a player wins or when the game results in a draw, immediately displaying the outcome for both players to see. To further enhance user engagement, I incorporated a restart option, enabling players to reset the board and replay the game without needing to refresh the page. I also focused on optimizing the user experience by ensuring the interface was intuitive and smooth, regardless of whether the game was accessed on mobile, tablet, or desktop devices.
